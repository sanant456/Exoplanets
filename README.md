# Exoplanets

Detecting exoplanets is challenging due to their vast distances from Earth and the bright glare of the stars they orbit. Scientists have developed several ingenious methods to find them:

Transit Method: This is the most successful method to date. When a planet passes directly between its star and an observer, it blocks a small fraction of the star's light. This slight dimming can be detected by powerful telescopes. The Kepler Space Telescope has used this method to discover thousands of exoplanets.



Radial Velocity (Doppler Wobble): A planet's gravitational pull causes its host star to "wobble" slightly in its orbit. This wobble can be detected by observing tiny shifts in the star's light spectrum—a phenomenon known as the Doppler effect.


Direct Imaging: This method involves taking a direct picture of the exoplanet. It is extremely difficult due to the overwhelming brightness of the host star. Special instruments are used to block the starlight, making it possible to see the much fainter planet.


Gravitational Microlensing: When a star passes in front of a more distant star, its gravity can bend and magnify the light of the background star. If the foreground star has a planet, the planet's gravity can cause an additional, brief spike in the magnification.
